### Address Book

The user is asked to type additional information for contact like adrress, phone and name.
Once the user has entered all their contacts, we should allow them to search in
them by name. We only allow exact matches.
If a contact with such a name is found, we write his phone number. It is permissible to have
contacts with the same names.
If we do not find the specified name in our contact list, we write: Not found.
